I really enjoyed this [Learning DNS in 10 years](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/05/08/new-talk-learning-dns-in-10-years/) talk by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca). Not only does it present a great, lightweight walkthrough on DNS, but it espouses a maxim for learning I really appreciate: keep `dig`ging, and when you get stuck, keep `dig`ging.
