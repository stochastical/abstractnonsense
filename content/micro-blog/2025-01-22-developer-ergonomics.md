> "I wonder how much it is insightful to watch someone doing a workflow and to note when discomfort kicks in. That's a really insightful thing to realize what matters from bitter experience, right?  ... Experience tells you when to worry about somethingÂ and when not to worry about it" - _Ben Sparks_

That is - the rising discomfort of a programmer when employing a new tool, framework, or library is a good window into the ergonomics of how one uses your tool, framework, or library. Source: [How I animate 3Blue1Brown | A Manim demo with Ben Sparks](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI?feature=shared). The whole video is worth checking out! It's a masterclass on how to construct a programatic-animation library and demonstrate how to work within it.

When I get a chance, I'd love to unpack the source code for how sprite-to-sprite transforms (part of 3B1B's signature look) and the vectorised rendering engine are implemented with OpenGL.
