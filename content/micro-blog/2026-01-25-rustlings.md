As part of my recent quest to learn Rust, I worked through the [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org) exercises. You're given a series of ~100 problems, and your goal is to fix the code to make it compile with passing tests. It was a pretty quick whirl-through, and I don't think the examples are the most interesting, but as a short introduction to the syntax and rudiments of the semantics, it does the trick with aplomb. I did quite enjoy the interactive problem-solving CLI interface, though.
