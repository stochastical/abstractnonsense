I came across [this great piece](https://fabiensanglard.net/blog/) on the act of blogging. Since I started pursuing blogging as a practice, it's been a very rewarding experience. But my drafts and ideas list is ever growing and my output of *substantive* content is decreasing proportionately.

I've learnt a lot from the simple act of setting up my blog in the first instance: from quality learnings about internet networking through to the dreaded menagerie of tooling that frontend developers call 'the web'. But I can't deny I spend far too much time blogging about blogging than I do **actually blogging** (this post is no exception).

[This](https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/) succinct graphic visualises the blog-metablog tragedy:

I mean to change this, I really do. I just can't deny it's far easier to sit down and _feel_ productive by fixing yet-another website presentation bug than it is to actually be productive by sitting down to write quality content. This is the tyranny of meta-blogging. But good content doesn't come without discipline and effort, and I am vowing to myself to reverse the balance.
