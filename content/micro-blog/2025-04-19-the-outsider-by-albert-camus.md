description: Book review of The Outsider by Albert Camus
---

Just finished The Outsider by Albert Camus (also known as The Stranger). Reading it felt like walking through an impressionist painting. Finishing it, one is left with a slightly blurred picture of a life — bleak yet nostalgic, emotionally distant yet resoundingly poignant.

Some highlights:

- New word learnt: “_lading_”: _put cargo onboard a ship_
- Wine with lunch! How quintessentially French…
- Trams everywhere! A halcyon stalwart construction of bygone days

Despite the surrealism, everything feels strangely real - detached, yet vivid. The first-person voice and inner monologue makes everything feel in equal parts clear and blurry.  

One feels as much an Outsider to the book as the protagonist himself.

Reading it in the autumn made me think
> Existentialism is to falling leaves as a book is to trees — both are susurrations of impermanence; one traces the shedding of meaning, the other preserves. What is lost and what remains.
