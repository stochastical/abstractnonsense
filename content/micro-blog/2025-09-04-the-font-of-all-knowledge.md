TIL that Google Search has a font-based Easter Egg. If you search for ["Georgia font"](https://www.google.com/search?q=Georgia+font), the results page will change the typeface to [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)). I initially thought it was limited to System-fonts, but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_Easter_eggs) shows that it works for [Roboto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboto) too!

I discovered this when looking up various fonts for this blog. I initially specified the default browser sans-serif font in my CSS, but ended up switching to Georgia for the text-body as I find it more readable for longer posts. There are some beautiful fonts in [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com) I'd love to use, but for now I'm going to stick with the [System Font Stack](https://systemfontstack.com) to avoid loading more external resources on page-load.
