I came across a short alliterative poem about [Rorschach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_(character)) I wrote a good while back after reading [_The Watchmen_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen):

> Manic milieu meets maimed mien,
> moralising meandering misanthropic menace,
> metes most morbid measures masked,
> macabre murmurs marry much moribund musings,
> massacring measly men mirthlessly

I don't know why I decided to pick 'm' here for the alliteration, but I often enjoy writing such whimsical snippets. I'm not sure what you'd call this, but I suppose 'extreme alliteration' or [_reverse lipogram_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogram#Reverse_lipogram) would suffice. I quite like the whole field of [constrained writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing), it's quite fun thinking about how to slot words into constraints just-so. Apparently there was (is?) a group of French mathematicians and writers who similarly delighted in such pursuits... the [Oulipo (_Ouvroir de litt√©rature potentielle_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo).

Amazingly, I asked ChatGPT who it thought the poem was about, with no other context provided, and it nailed it ([link to chat](https://chatgpt.com/share/68822874-f890-800c-8c72-c4bb6becc70f)).
