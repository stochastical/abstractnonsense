I'm not much of a gamer. In fact, I don't think I've played any games in the past decade.

But I do have very fond memories of playing a couple games on an old translucent [iMac G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3) in the school computer room in primary.

On some late night Wikipedia rabbit hole I ended up on the page for [Antz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antz) and was reminded of the old-school-cool games I'd played: [Bugdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugdom) and [Nanosaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosaur).

It turns out, theyâ€™re been [immortalised](https://jorio.itch.io) and ported to run on macOS with Apple Silicon. You can download them (for free): [Nanosaur](https://github.com/jorio/Nanosaur) and [Bugdom2](https://github.com/jorio/Bugdom2). They run like a charm and with beautiful graphics scaling to boot!
