I've been reading through [Step-by-Step Diffusion: An Elementary Tutorial](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/diffusion-elementary-tutorial) by Apple ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08929)). The mathematics underpinning diffusion language or image models is quite complex, but this walkthrough strikes a nice balance between concrete mathematical grounding and intuition.
