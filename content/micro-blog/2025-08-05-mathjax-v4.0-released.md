[MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src) [v4.0](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src/releases/tag/4.0.0) has been [released](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-4.0.html)!

I just integrated MathJax v3 with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) last night for this blog to start writing some maths posts, and v4 is released today...

I'm hoping it improves rendering though, I was seeing some issues with SVG output for inline formulae in Safari. [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) is neat and fast, but I find the quality of the typesetting to be quite sub-par compared to MathJax.
