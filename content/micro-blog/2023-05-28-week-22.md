1. I noted that there's a difference between [Anomaly detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection) and [Outlier detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier).
2. ==Word of the week== ~ **enjambement**
    > **enjambement**: (in verse) the continuation of a sentence without a pause beyond the end of a line, couplet, or stanza.
3. As an aside, I find Rust as a language fiendishly complex at a first glance, and Iâ€™m amazed by people who find it so straightforward. Having said that, I'd much rather have lived in a universe where Rust was the first 'low-level' language I learnt instead of C.
