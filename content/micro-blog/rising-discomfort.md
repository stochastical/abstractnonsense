> "Rising discomfort of a programmer when employing a new tool, framework, or library is a good window into the ergonomics of using your tool, framework, or library."

Source: [How I animate 3Blue1Brown | A Manim demo with Ben Sparks](https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-rbu7Zu5X1zI?start=1624&end=1800). The whole video is worth checking out! It's a masterclass on how to construct a programatic-animation library.

When I get a chance, I'd love to unpack the source code for how sprite-to-sprite transforms are done (part of 3B1B's signature look), and the vectorised rendering engine implementation.
