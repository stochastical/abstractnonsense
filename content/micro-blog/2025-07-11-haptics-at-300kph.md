Apple released a new "Haptic Trailer" for their new [F1 movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_(film)) - you can check it out in the Apple TV app. It's a pretty neat experience, I'd never thought about adding haptics to a playback experience, but it really does add another dimension of immersion.

I was curious on how it was implemented, and stumbled across a great [blog post](https://www.mux.com/blog/how-apple-made-the-f1-movie-trailer-literally-shake-things-up) that really shook it out for me... I'm sure it'd get horrifically overused, but it'd be interesting to see whether this gets adopted into more media streams in the future.
