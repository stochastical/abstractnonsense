## Hi, I'm Yossi Frenkel

Welcome to _Abstract Nonsense_! ![hover here](fn "[Abstract Nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense) is a (hopefully, joking) pejorative for the mathematical subject of [Category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory), or, really, all things arcane.")

I studied mathematics and computer science at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), and currently work as an early-career AI researcher and data scientist at CommBank AI Labs. I enjoy writing about maths, computer science, and anything that piques my interest!
