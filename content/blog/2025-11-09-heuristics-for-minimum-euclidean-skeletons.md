    A retrospective look at my 2021 University of Melbourne vacation research project on minimum Euclidean skeletons, a geometric graph theory optimisation problem.

> **Disclaimer**: This blog post is a rehash of some exploration I did as part of the [Mathematics and Statistics Vacation Scholarship](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/engage/vacation-scholarships) program at the University of Melbourne in January 2021. It's been a while since then, so please forgive any inaccuracies that are almost assuredly present.

> The poster I presented at the conclusion of the program was hosted on the UniMelb website but has suffered the demise of linkrot. I think it's an interesting problem, though; so I'm reposting my notes here for posterity and as a reminder to myself to revisit this topic and provide a more polished and accurate treatment (with code samples).
